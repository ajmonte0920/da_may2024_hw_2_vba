Hw 2 for Data Science Bootcamp

For this homework I used VBA scripting, along with conditional formattting, to analyze generated stock market data. 

Wrote VBA script to:
    -compile/organize meta data 
    -provide summary outputs for the meta data

Code source:
    - Self created source code (majority). 
    - Used xpert learning assistant to assist with the detailing of my source code.
    - Used instructor created code to assit with detailing the "worksheet looping" portion of  my soruce code.
